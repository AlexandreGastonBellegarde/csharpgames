# Learning C# by Programming Games, second edition

This repository contains the sample code, solutions to the exercises and game assets belonging to the book ["Learning C# by Programming Games", second edition](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642365799).

Developing computer games is a perfect way to learn how to program in modern programming languages. This book teaches you how to program in the language C# through the creation of computer games – and without requiring any previous programming experience.

Contrary to most programming books, we do not organize the presentation according to programming language constructs, but instead use the structure and elements of computer games as a framework. For instance, there are chapters on dealing with player input, game objects, game worlds, game states, levels, animation, physics, and intelligence. The reader will be guided through the development of four games showing the various aspects of game development. Starting with a simple shooting game, we move on to puzzle games consisting of multiple levels, and conclude the book by developing a full-fledged platform game with animation, game physics, and intelligent enemies. We show a number of commonly used techniques in games, such as drawing layers of sprites, rotating, scaling and animating sprites, dealing with physics, handling interaction between game objects, and creating pleasing visual effects. At the same time, we provide a thorough introduction to C# and object-oriented programming, introducing step by step important programming concepts such as loops, methods, classes, collections, and exception handling.

The book is also designed to be used as a basis for a game-oriented programming course at university level. Supplementary materials for organizing such a course (including solutions to all exercises) are available in this repository, along with all example programs, game sprites, and sounds.

## About the Second Edition
This second edition of the book includes the following improvements: 
1. The book and all example programs are now based on the library MonoGame 3.6, instead of the obsolete XNA Game Studio. 
2. Instead of explaining how the example programs work, the text now invites readers to write these programs themselves, with clearly marked reference points throughout the text. 
3. The book now makes a clearer distinction between general (C#) programming concepts and concepts that are specific to game development. 
4. The most important programming concepts are now summarized in convenient “Quick Reference” boxes, which replace the syntax diagrams of the first edition. 
5. The updated exercises are now grouped per chapter and can be found at the end of each chapter, allowing readers to test their knowledge more directly.

## About the authors
**Wouter van Toll** is a post-doctoral researcher at Inria in Rennes, France, as well as a fanatic developer of games and apps. His research focuses on simulating the behavior of human crowds. Previously, he was a lecturer at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. He has taught several bachelor and master courses there, including the introductory Game programming course designed by co-author Arjan Egges.
  
**Jeroen D. Fokker** is an assistant professor in the Software Technology group at Utrecht University. As the director of education, he is responsible for the undergraduate programs in Computer Science and Information Science. He has been teaching introductory programming courses for over 20 years, using C++, Haskell, Java, and C#, as well as courses on compiler construction.
  
**Arjan Egges** was an associate professor in the Games and Virtual Worlds group in the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. He has ample teaching experience related to games and computer animation, and he designed the introductory programming course for the university's Game Technology bachelor program, using C# as the language of choice. Arjan is currently working at a startup he has launched, Fans4Music, to help musicians earn a living through a web platform.
